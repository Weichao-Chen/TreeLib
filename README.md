Which was uncomfortable for the user due to many reasons.<br/> Now all what the user has to do is simply type the keyword he/she would like to search for, then he/she will be given all the available results.<br/> See commit https://github.com/hema-001/TreeLib/commit/db2d6be568daf65b71ec479993eb99890c2478ab for more details.
